# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment
#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
 a) It is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems which involves problem identification, design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance.
 b) importances include:creayion of sytems and systems that make everyday life easier with regards to issues such as communication, transport and health 
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 a) development of programming languages such as C in the later 1940's-this helped in early programming of sytems and softwares that were used to advanced the research for better programming languages.
 b) regulation of software engineering- establishment of software engineering as a discipline made it more relevant ensuring a code of standard could be established to guide professionals within the sector in their work
 c) advancement of structured programming- a variety of prgramming languanges arose ensuring efficiency by offering a variety of methodologies that could be used to tackle and find solutions to problems 
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a)problem identification- a problem to be solved is identified and possible solutions are brought forward such as understanding end user needs and wants
b) design-once the requirements have been understood, a solution is set up through coding to arrive at the optimal solution
c) development- the problems are transformed to computer based solutions or mobile apps 
d) testing- the solution is put under rigorous checks to verify its workability with improvements
e) deployment- once the checks are completed the solution is rolled out for use 
f) maintenance- regular updates to the solution to make sure it performs efficiently to the requirements
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
a)waterfall method occurs in aseries of phases and is structured to occur in a particular way from requirements down to  implementation while the agile method is solely focused on maters partaining to collaboration, flexibility and response to change.
b) agile methodolgy requires collaboration amongst various stake holders while for waterfall method a single developer can undertake the work to meet the deliverables.
c) agile methodology can be used in big complex and ever changing projects with tight deadlines while for waterfall everything is structured and due process is followed to meet onjectives 
d)agile method can be used for projects such as social media platforms such as tiktok or instagram where trends usually come and go and the design has to tailor such to meet the consumers needs
e)waterfall method can be used for projects such as developing a payment and invoicing ssytem for a logistics firm.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a) software developer-writes the code for a solution and is involved in implemetation of the code 
b) quality assurance engineer- ensures the solution provided is upto the required standards by providing rigorous checks
c) project manager-provides oversight by directing the planning, execution and delivery of software projects 
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a) they provide a platform from where people can collaborate and a variety of features that help developers to efficiently deliver on the projects within time and to the desired quality
b) examples of IDEs: visual studio while examples of VCS include Git
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a) tight schedules where projects are to be delivered within a timeframe. b) requirements which keep on changing affecting scope and deliverables. c) incompetency where lack of technical experience and knowledge leads to solutions that are sub standard raising maintenance cost due to quality.
B) solutions include: a) proper planning of projects to ensure they can be met within a certain timeframe without compromisisng on quality b) defining of objectives to ensure the scope does not change when works begin  c) use of qualified personnel to deliver optimal solutions that are to the required standards and quality 
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a) unit-individual testing of a component from the rest of the system. importance: to check on the correctness of code and form basis for other checks 
b) intergration- testing of the relations between different components in a system. importance : identify issues that may affect how components correlate
c) system- testing of the whole system as to the specifications in that it fucntions as a whole without glitches. importance: check if system meets fucntional requirements.
d) acceptance- testing done by end users to ensure their needs are met.  importance: get the end user approval for complete roll out

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
a) it is the process where we craft questions in an optimal way to get the best responses from AI models 
b) importance include to get clear, precise and concise asnswers from AI models minimizing vagueness
Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
a) explain the world as a whole?
b) clearly expalin how the world came to be using the nebular cloud theory explaining it advantages and shortcomings?
c) its is more eefective as it outlines key areas i want my answer to be based on.
